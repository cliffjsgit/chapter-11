# Exercise 11.6
#
#
# Grading Guidelines:
# - No answer variable is needed. Grading script will call function.
# - Function "find_homophones" should output list of all words that solve
# the Puzzler,
#
# 1. Here's another Puzzler from Car Talk 
# (http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzlers):
#
# This was sent in by a fellow named Dan O'Leary. He came upon a common
# one-syllable, five-letter word recently that has the following unique 
# property. When you remove the first letter, the remaining letters form a 
# homophone of the original word, that is a word that sounds exactly the same. 
# Replace the first letter, that is, put it back and remove the second letter 
# and the result is yet another homophone of the original word. And the question
# is, what's the word?
#
# Now I'm going to give you an example that doesn't work.  Let's look at the
# five-letter word, ‘wrack.'  W-R-A-C-K, you know like to ‘wrack with pain.'
# If I remove the first letter, I am left with a four-letter word, 'R-A-C-K.' 
# As in, ‘Holy cow, did you see the rack on that buck! It must have been a nine-
# pointer!' It's a perfect homophone. If you put the ‘w' back, and remove the 
# ‘r,' instead, you're left with the word, ‘wack,' which is a real word, it's 
# just not a homophone of the other two words.
#
# But there is, however, at least one word that Dan and we know of, which will 
# yield two homophones if you remove either of the first two letters to make 
# two, new four-letter words. The question is, what's the word?
# 
# You can use the dictionary from Exercise 11.1 to check whether a string is in
# the word list.
# 
# To check whether two words are homophones, you can use the CMU Pronouncing 
# Dictionary. You can download it from http://thinkpython2.com/code/c06d.txt 
# and you can also download http://thinkpython2.com/code/pronounce.py
# which provides a function named read_dictionary that reads the pronouncing
# dictionary and returns a Python dictionary that maps from each word to a string
# that describes its primary pronunciation.
# 
# Write a function "find_homophones" returns a list of all the words that 
# solve the Puzzler.
